## deploy you application in the cloud

1. open git bash shell and go to the directory of the exercise solution: `cd /path/to/git/directory/exercises/day1-apache-camel/PXLExercice2025Solution`  
   From now do everything from that shell instance.
2. in the shell set you AWS VM DNS in a variable.  
   The DNS is the file exercises/day1-apache-camel/assets/student-vms.json next your student number. Copy it and put in a variable.  
   In this example replace "ec2-123-123-123-123.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com" with the DNS name you have found:  
   `MY_AWS_DNS=ec2-123-123-123-123.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com`
3. install java on your VM.  
   a. login on your remote VM. In git bash: `ssh -i ../assets/PXL-key.pem ec2-user@$MY_AWS_DNS`  
   b. now you are on the remote VM  
   c. Install java on the VM: `sudo dnf install java-21-amazon-corretto-devel -y`  
   d. run the `exit` command to return on you locale machine in the git bash shell  
4. Configure your Kafka topic logins in the application.properties file located at: exercises/day1-apache-camel/PXLExercice2025Solution/src/main/resources/application.properties  
   Update the property values using the credentials provided for your student number (replace XX with your actual student number).  
   The topic names must remain unchanged.  
   Youâ€™ll find your credentials in the directory: exercises/day3-event-automation/Assets/TopicCredentials/  
   Each file will follow this naming format:  
   - StudentXX_ticket.purchase.requested_prod.json
   - StudentXX_ticket.payment.status_cons.json
   - StudentXX_ticket.inventory.updated_cons.json
   ```properties
   # Purchase Requested Producer
   kafka.festival.purchases.client.id=<value of "id" from purchase.requested_prod.json>
   kafka.festival.purchases.sasl-jaas-config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="<username from purchase.requested_prod.json>" password="<password from purchase.requested_prod.json>";
   
   # Payment Status Consumer
   kafka.festival.purchases.status.client.id=<value of "id" from payment.status_cons.json>
   kafka.festival.purchases.status.sasl-jaas-config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="<username from payment.status_cons.json>" password="<password from payment.status_cons.json>";
   
   # Inventory Updated Consumer
   kafka.festival.purchases.inventory.client.id=<value of "id" from inventory.updated_cons.json>
   kafka.festival.purchases.inventory.sasl-jaas-config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="<username from inventory.updated_cons.json>" password="<password from inventory.updated_cons.json>";
   ```
5. build your application in one bit fat executable jar containing everything together.  
   Run: `mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar`  
6. copy the resulting jar and the kafka pem to your VM:   
   `scp -i ../assets/PXL-key.pem target/pxl-training-exercise1-solution-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar src/main/resources/purchases.kafka.pem ec2-user@$MY_AWS_DNS:~`
7. run your application from the remote vm:  
   a. login on your remote VM. In git bash: `ssh -i ../assets/PXL-key.pem ec2-user@$MY_AWS_DNS`  
   b. now you are on the remote VM  
   c. run your application in the background: `nohup java -jar pxl-training-exercise1-solution-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar 2>&1 &`  
   d. You'll find a 'nohup.out' file in the same directory. It collects the output logs of your application.  
   f You can use it to follow what is going on by tailing it: `tail -f nohup.out`  
     To stop tailing the logs it hit: ctrl + c  
   g. you can exit the remote vm, the application will keep running: `exit`  
8. test your application. In postman, change localhost with http://[YOUR-VM-DNS]:8080  
   The dns is the value of the $MY_AWS_DNS variable. You can read the value with the command: `echo $MY_AWS_DNS` or  
   in the exercises/day1-apache-camel/assets/student-vms.json next your student number.  
   Send a request with a valid body. There is body example in src/test/resources/samples/ticketPurchaseBody.json.
9. optionally, if you want to stop your java application you have to kill it of login on the remote vm.  
   First log on your vm: `ssh -i ../assets/PXL-key.pem ec2-user@$MY_AWS_DNS`  
   Find the PID (process id). This is an example on a random VM:  
   ```shell
   [ec2-user@ip-172-31-21-86 ~]$ ps -ef | grep java
   ec2-user  474523  474498 98 10:50 pts/0    00:00:03 java -jar /home/ec2-user/pxl-training-base-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
   ec2-user  474538  474498  0 10:50 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto java
   ```
   The PID here is 474523. Use it to kill your java process:
   ```shell
   kill -9 474523
   ```
