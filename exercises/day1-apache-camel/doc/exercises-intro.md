The exercise is to implement the presented integration logic on Camel.

You will start from a base project that already has:
- all the dependencies required for all the steps defined
- an 'hello world' Camel route
- an integration test for Kafka ready to use  

The exercice will make you:

2. Implement a scheduled API request call and send the response to Kafka.
3. Extra: consume Kafka events en send an notification for each of them. 
4. Extra: error handling.
