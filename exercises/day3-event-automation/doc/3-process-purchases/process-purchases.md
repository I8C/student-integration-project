# Lets process our events
In this exercise, we will create a simple flink flow to process the purchases and confirm the payment status. This will be a simplified
solution. 

## EEM: create new topics
We will start by creating new topics in IBM Event Endpoint Management to allow us to consume and produce events by using Event Processing (EP)

	- Create a consuming topic (STXX-TICKET.PURCHASE.REQUESTED) with an approval policy for Flink
	- Request access and download credentials for EP
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	- Tip: you can play with the schema enforcement and see how EP reacts
